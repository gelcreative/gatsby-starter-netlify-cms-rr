## FINANCIAL TOOLS

### Health and dental insurance

As Canadians, we’re fortunate to have one of the best healthcare systems in the world, but government healthcare coverage may not provide all you need.

You may be left to pay for expenses such as:

* Prescription drugs
* Dental visits
* Eye exams
* Paramedic services
* Ambulance transport

Enhanced healthcare plans can help protect you against these and other unexpected health and dental expenses
