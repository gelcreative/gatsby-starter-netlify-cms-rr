bio: >-
  Gary has a degree in Economics and Finance from Western University. He joined
  London Life as a Financial Security advisor in 1993, and then transitioned in
  to a management role. As a Manager, he was responsible for growing sales
  teams, teaching new advisors and developing future business leaders. Two years
  ago, he made the decision to return to the Financial Security Advisor role and
  get back to helping his clients achieve their financial goals. Gary says he
  joined RetireRite because “RetireRite’s reputation for integrity and
  delivering unparalleled value and service to its clients aligns with my client
  approach”. Gary’s various roles with London Life have given him a wealth of
  knowledge and experience that he applies to each of his clients, and he is
  able to educate his clients about insurance and investing while he works with
  them to secure their financial future.


  Gary and his wife Melissa have three grown children, and enjoy travelling and
  spending time with family.
