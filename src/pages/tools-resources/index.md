### Health and Dental Insurance

As Canadians, we’re fortunate to have one of the best healthcare systems in the world, but government healthcare coverage may not provide all you need.

You may be left to pay for expenses such as:

* Prescription drugs
* Dental visits
* Eye exams
* Paramedic services
* Ambulance transport

Enhanced healthcare plans can help protect you against these and other unexpected health and dental expenses

### Plan Direct Guaranteed Issue

Our Guaranteed Issue plans offer enhanced coverage for individuals, and can help fill the gap between your provincial plan coverage and what you pay.

### Long Term Care Insurance

Long term care insurance can provide coverage if you become unable to care for yourself and need assistance to manage daily living activities. Long term care isn't just for seniors; it can also cover some of the costs of a care facility or a caregiver in your own home following an accident or illness.
