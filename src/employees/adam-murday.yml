bio: >-
  Adam previously owned a business consulting firm and spent much of his early
  career working and traveling all over the Western Hemisphere, problem solving
  for Fortune 500 companies like Mercedes-Benz, Shell and Potash. After years of
  living on the road, Adam was engaged and purchased a home in Barrie, were he
  begin to think about his future family. In a bid to build a local business
  where he could be more involved in his family, he changed his focus away from
  large corporations. Looking back to a previous opportunity, and a childhood
  that was deeply entangled in the profession (ask him about it!), Adam felt
  confident that he would find his place as a Financial Security Advisor and
  joined Freedom 55 Financial in 2017. Now as an ex-corporate problem solver,
  he's turned his attention to helping families, professionals and small
  businesses develop strong financial foundations, help protect the things that
  are important to them and implement strategies to help them get from where
  they are, to where they want to be.
