title: About RetireRite
intro: >-
  RetireRite Financial Strategies Inc. was born in 1996, as way to fully
  separate my advisor practice from my management role. Building my business
  under RetireRite means the equity of my practice will be founded on the most
  trusted names in the financial services industry – London Life, Sun Life,
  Manulife, to name a few.  At RetireRite, we believe in delivering the highest
  value with added service and commitment to professionalism, ethics and
  education. I look for like-minded people to add to the team, and I truly
  believe that our current team members are as dedicated to our clients as I am.
  We follow a proven process which includes understanding clients’ goals and
  current financial position, reviewing their sources of income and savings,
  developing a confidential, customized retirement investment plan and reviewing
  and monitoring the plan on an on-going basis.
