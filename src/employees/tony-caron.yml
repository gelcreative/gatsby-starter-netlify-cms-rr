bio: >-
  I started my career with London Life in 1985 as a Security Advisor in Lindsay,
  Ontario. After four years as an advisor I was asked to join management, where
  I held several management roles over the next 27 years, including spending the
  last 7 as the Regional Director in Simcoe/ Muskoka. 


  My passion has always been helping clients as a Financial Planner, which is
  why I continued to service and support a small block of clients while holding
  management roles. In 2017, I retired from management to focus on working with
  my clients on a full-time basis.


  I strive to provide my clients with educated advice. I am continually
  upgrading my skills through membership in the Canadian Association of
  Insurance and Financial Advisors (CAIFA) and by obtaining professional
  designations such as: Certified Financial Planner (CFP), Chartered Life
  Underwriter (CLU), Chartered Financial Consultant (CH.F.C.), Certified
  Investment Manager (CIM), Financial Management Advisor (FMA) and Chartered
  Strategic Wealth Professional (CSWP).


  I take great pride in being able to help people realize their dreams by
  encouraging them to continue to see the benefits of their discipline. A good
  financial coach can keep you excited about your objective and celebrate your
  successes with you. Over the years my clients have become my friends; I am
  personally invested in providing transparency, value and the highest quality
  customer service. My business growing has solely come from existing client
  referrals, and for that we are truly grateful.
