  Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a structured approach to buying investments.
  DCA is intended to temper the volatility of your investment portfolio by
  breaking large holding purchases into smaller buys done over time.

  Another benefit of DCA is the structured discipline required to plan and
  execute the purchases.
