  A financial plan is like a roadmap to achieving the financial future you
  envision. It starts by identifying where you are financially and provides
  directions for getting to where you want to go.

There are many areas that make up your finances: your assets and liabilities, investment portfolio, cash flow, tax situation, retirement income, insurance and estate plan (or lack thereof). Your lifestyle also plays a role. For a financial plan to be effective, each one of these areas must be addressed in a coordinated way in order to provide a personalized, comprehensive financial solution.

As with any goal or strategy, a financial plan must have objectives. How do you see yourself five, ten or 20+ years in the future? After determining your current financial state in the areas mentioned above, you will need to establish a clear vision in order to start creating and implementing a plan. This includes what your retirement lifestyle will be, because only then can you determine needs for investments and income. If you have children, it may also include funding for their education or other endeavors.

Once you’ve clarified your current financial situation and understand your vision for the future, calculations can then be made to determine how your assets need to grow in order to reach those goals. This will determine the investment plan that you’ll need to produce the necessary returns from your assets.

A comprehensive financial plan must also take into account the tax ramifications of your finances and identify strategies to minimize your tax liabilities. Additionally, your financial plan should mitigate risk and protect your wealth through the use of tools such as insurance products. The use of insurance can also be beneficial in your estate plan, as there are ways to minimize taxation and maximize the wealth of your estate.

Working with a financial advisor can ensure that your comprehensive financial plan coordinates all of these areas in order to maximize the wealth potential from your current financial situation. If you want to start mapping out your financial future, make an appointment to speak with one of our advisors.
