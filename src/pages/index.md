  Everyoneâ€™s needs and dreams are different. The time to start making them

  happen is right now, and it all starts with having a financial plan.


  <span class="larger-text">Studies show that Canadians backed by a
  comprehensive financial plan feel:</span>


  * More on track with their financial goals and retirement plans

  * They have improved their ability to save in the past five years

  * Equipped to deal with unexpected financial emergencies and to weather tough
    economic times
  * Able to indulge in their discretionary spending goals


  Furthermore, regardless of net worth, **Canadians working with a financial

  advisor** hold more assets, save at a higher rate, and report significantly

  higher levels of financial and emotional well-being than non-advised

  Canadians.
