A few months ago, London Life and Great West Life announced that they would be merging under the Canada Life brand, creating the new Canada Life. This transition to one brand will allow the company to combine strengths & resources, streamline products & processes, and continue to help improve the financial, physical and mental well-being of Canadians. Over the next several months, you’ll continue to see the three separate company logos, alongside the new Canada Life logo and brand.

What does this mean for you? Right now, not much. Your policies will remain the same, and you will continue to be serviced by RetireRite Financial Strategies. In the future, this change will allow us access to a wider range of products and services to provide to our customers and helps build a stronger company.

Here at RetireRite, we’ve also undergone some changes. I am pleased to announce the addition of two associate advisors to our team – Adam Murday and Gary Hurst.

Adam previously owned a business consulting firm and spent much of his early career working and traveling all over the Western Hemisphere, problem solving for Fortune 500 companies like Mercedes-Benz, Shell and Potash. After years of living on the road, Adam was engaged and purchased a home in Barrie, were he begin to think about his future family. In a bid to build a local business where he could be more involved in his family, he changed his focus away from large corporations. Looking back to a previous opportunity, and a childhood that was deeply entangled in the profession (ask him about it!), Adam felt confident that he would find his place as a Financial Security Advisor and joined Freedom 55 Financial in 2017. Now as an ex-corporate problem solver, he's turned his attention to helping families, professionals and small businesses develop strong financial foundations, help protect the things that are important to them and Implement strategies to help them get from where they are, to where they want to be.

Gary has a degree in Economics and Finance from Western University. He joined London Life as a Financial Security advisor in 1993, and then transitioned in to a management role. As a Manager, he was responsible for growing sales teams, teaching new advisors and developing future business leaders. Two years ago, he made the decision to return to the Financial Security Advisor role and get back to helping his clients achieve their financial goals. Gary and his wife Melissa have three grown children and enjoy travelling and spending time with family. Gary says he joined RetireRite because “RetireRite’s reputation for integrity and delivering unparalleled value and service to its clients aligns with my client approach”. Gary’s various roles with London Life have given him a wealth of knowledge and experience that he applies to each of his clients, and he is able to educate his clients about insurance and investing while he works with them to secure their financial future. 

I have the utmost trust in and respect for both Adam and Gary, and the work that they do. I hired Gary back in 1993 and then brought him on to my management team because I knew that Gary was someone I could trust and rely on. We all share the same core values – honesty, integrity, professionalism and an unmatched dedication to client service. Adding Adam and Gary to our team strengthens our company and allows us to continue to meet with more clients and help them achieve their financial goals. I’m very excited for the future of RetireRite and what we can build together. Welcome to the team!

I hope you enjoy the rest of your summer, and I hope to speak to you soon.

Tony
