bio: >-
  I began my career with London Life as a sales representative in Lindsay,
  Ontario. I thoroughly enjoyed working as a sales representative and in
  1985-1986, I set a new London Life rookie sales record. Five years later, I
  moved to Orillia where I worked as a staff manager. In my current role, I
  focus on coaching financial security advisors as they work to establish
  successful businesses in the Georgian Bay region.
