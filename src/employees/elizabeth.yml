  I started working at Freedom 55 Financial in Barrie in 2009. Over the years I
  have provided administrative support to several top producing advisors, our
  wealth consultants and our mortgage specialist. I started working with Tony
  and his clients in 2015. I believe in building relationships with all our
  clients, so that they know that when they call our office, they will receive
  exceptional service and care.
