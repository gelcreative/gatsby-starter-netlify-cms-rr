Small businesses usually rely on a few key people to keep operations running smoothly. Whether it is a front-line supervisor that runs the crews, a senior leader for slightly larger businesses, or the founder and owner of a company, the absence of key people can really cripple short-term results, which can potentially place long-term business viability at risk.

Key Person Insurance is a risk management tool that helps to cover the loss of a valued contributor due to death or disability. Life, Critical Illness and Disability Insurance are all ways we can protect your business, and I can help you figure out which coverage works best for you.
