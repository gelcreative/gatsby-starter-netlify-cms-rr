  Small businesses usually rely on a few key people to keep operations running
  smoothly. Whether it is a front-line supervisor that runs the crews, a senior
  leader for slightly larger businesses, or the founder and owner of a company,
  the absence of key people can really cripple short-term results, which can
  potentially place long-term business viability at risk.
