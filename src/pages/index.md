  Everyoneâ€™s needs and dreams are different. The time to start making them
  happen is right now, and it all starts with having a financial plan. Studies
  show that Canadians backed by a comprehensive financial plan feel:


  * More on track with their financial goals and retirement plans

  * They have improved their ability to save in the past five years

  * Equipped to deal with unexpected financial emergencies and to weather tough
  economic times

  * Able to indulge in their discretionary spending goals


  Furthermore, regardless of net worth, Canadians working with a financial
  advisor hold more assets, save at a higher rate, and report significantly
  higher levels of financial and emotional well-being than non-advised
  Canadians.
