**SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS**

**Mortgages**\
To help our mortgage customers impacted by the global COVID-19 outbreak, we’re taking measures to provide a flexible solution to help manage the financial challenges, resulting from pay disruption, or illness caused by COVID-19.
\
If you’re experiencing financial hardship related to COVID-19, you may submit a request to defer your mortgage payments. You can contact our Mortgage Contact Centre by phone at 1-888-893-8383, or you can complete our online form found at :<https://www.canadalife.com/content/dam/canadalife/documents/loans-mortgages/online_form_for_mortgage_deferral.pdf>

**Insurance Premiums

We understand COVID-19 has had a huge financial impact on people and their ability to pay premiums. Premium vacation, policy loans and coverage reduction are some of the different options that we can discuss. Call your advisor or send us an email and we can help you figure out which available option will work best for you.

**COVID-19 Claims
**

**Life insurance claims
**\
Claims where cause of death is related to COVID-19 are fully covered as long as all questions within the application have been answered accurately, including questions related to recent travel history and current health, there is no exclusion on the policy and no change in insurability before policy delivery.

**Disability insurance claims
**\
You may be eligible for some benefits if you test positive for COVID-19 and your symptoms prevent you from working beyond your disability or overhead expense insurance policy’s waiting period. Any days spent in quarantine prior to the positive test (up to a maximum of 14 days) will be included in your waiting period. There are some disability benefits that aren’t eligible due to COVID-19. 

**Critical illness insurance claims
**\
You’re provided a lump-sum payment for specific medical conditions as defined in your policy, such as cancer, heart attack and stroke. COVID-19 is not currently a covered condition and wouldn’t be eligible for a benefit payout. 
\
To find out if you are eligible to make a COVID related claim on your insurance, contact your advisor or email us and we'll help you out.
