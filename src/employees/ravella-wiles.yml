bio: >-
  Ravella started her career in 1998 with a large banking institution. Through
  her various roles as Account Manager, Senior Account Manager and Branch
  Manager, she formed strong bonds and relationships with her clients. Putting
  plans in place to help clients realize their goals of home ownership, setting
  their children up for future success and helping clients transition and enjoy
  their retirement years was a joy that turned in to a passion. As with many
  banking careers, Ravella worked in several cities, including Markham, Truro
  NS, Barrie, Tottenham, Keswick, Kitchener, Toronto and Aurora, before
  returning to Barrie. Throughout these years and travels, Ravella has continued
  to maintain strong relationships with many clients she has met along the way.


  Ravella joined Freedom 55 Financial in 2017. With her extensive banking and
  investment experience now coupled with insurance planning, Ravella is truly
  able to provider her clients with a holistic plan to not only achieve foals
  but also maintain their lifestyle, even through adversity. Ravella believes
  that providing her clients information to make an educated decision, charting
  a strategic plan and executing with diligence are the keys to her clients'
  financial success.


  Ravella lives in Barrie with her husband and her two children.
